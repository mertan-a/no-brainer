# No-brainer: Adaptive behavior without separately postulated brains

This is the code for the paper "Adaptive Behavior without Separately Postulated Brains".

# A short summary

We evolve virtual robots that exhibit adaptive behavior (changing the direction of locomotion in response to changes in the stimuli) by using only reactive materials (no separately postulated brains e.g. neural networks). A swarm of such robots, under certain assumptions, could exhibit any computable behavior.
